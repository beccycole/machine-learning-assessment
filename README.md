## About the Dataset

The Boston Housing Dataset contains information collected by the US Census Service in 1970 on various house prices in the area of Boston. The dataset is small in size with only 506 samples and 14 variables. The data gives values for various features of different suburbs of Boston as well as the median-value for homes in each suburb. The features were chosen to reflect various aspects believed to influence houses prices including the structure of the house (age and spaciousness), the quality of the neighborhood, transportation access to employment centers and highways, and pollution.

## Objective

The goals of this assessment are as follows:

 - describe the dataset using descriptive statistics and plots.
 - use inferential statistics to determine whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along    the Charles river and those that are not.
 - use keras to create a neural network that can predict the medium house price based on the other variables in the dataset
